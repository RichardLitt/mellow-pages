This week we’re excited to announce some big changes to our membership model. This model will give us the sustainability we need to keep the library open, as well as offer an easy avenue to support our community from afar. 

We have added a “Join” link just below our logo. New memberships can now be paid through a monthly subscription of $5 a month, and you can sign up from home or your phone. This is an automatic draw that allows us to manage our monthly progress, and decreases the burden of your membership to twelve manageable payments. 

We are also making one-time donations easy. Just choose the bottom option and donate whatever you would like. Keep in mind that you can always sign up as a way of showing support, even if you don’t live in the area. Explore the options in the “Join” page and if you have any questions, as always, feel free to email us at <i>mellowpageslibrary@gmail.com</i>.

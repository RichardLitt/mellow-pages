Howdy Duders,

The time has come to rub a shine back onto the muckymuck. After a whole lot of deliberation and nail biting we’ve made the hard decision to close the library (temporarily!) at the end of May. We’re ending our lease on Bogart Street and handing over the reins to a small group of do-gooders, and in the meantime (after the 31st) we’ll be boxing up our trove of small press books and storing them for a brief (hopefully) period while a new model and a new space is found. Whoopee!

Still have a book checked out? Still want to check out a book? Great! We’ll be open all month, or at least til the moving gets rolling, so stick around and maybe think about helping us pack up. This includes returning books so they can go where they’re supposed to go, i.e., if donated by a member, it should go back to that member, small-press should go in the small press box for the next library, etc.

What WE’D REALLY LIKE TO DO IS: parse the collection down to the barest and greatest essentials, the whys of our heres. This will help with storing/moving woes and also give the new library exactly what it needs, and exactly what we all want: independent books.

That being said, a good chunk of our current collection was loaned to us through You, and we’d like for you to reclaim those books if you want them, before they potentially hit the chopping block. We’ll be holding a fundraiser/book sale for the future library beginning May 15th. A portion of said donated books may or may not be up for sale, so come early if you’re looking to get ahold of the good stuff. All sales go to the future Mellow Pages.

If you’ve got books here that you want back, you’ll have the next two weeks to come get them. Or, you can let us know you still want your books and we’ll set them aside throughout the sale! Please pass the word on to anyone you might know so that we’re all in the loop. We’re open Wed-Sun 12-7, if you were wondering, and we’d love to help you scour the piles for your books.

Again, this will be a fundraiser. It’ll be rough starting over but this is one way we can make the transition less arduous. Two birds with one stone.

Other things will be for sale as well. Furniture. Well, just lots of furniture. And a guitar. A few blankets, too. Art? Art supplies? Sure thing, Bee Sting!

If you’d like to help moving, we’re sure going to need it. Have you always been pinched by the lack of organization? Here’s your last chance dance to see a perfected system at work.

Also, we’ve got events lined up throughout the month, so make sure to come and pay your respects to the soon to be dead. After all is said and done and the room is clean, cleansed, and clear of our fingerprints, we’re going to party. We’d love to see you! There’s not enough room here to tell you how much we’d love to see you. But if we do see you, you’ll know.
